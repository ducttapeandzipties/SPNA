    <h3>About Us</h3>
    We have lots to offer and invite everyone to come live work and play in Shelby Park!  This neighborhood has a very storied history and a bright future.  Shelby Park is centrally located, which means it is close to all of your favorite Louisville attractions.  We are just a stones throw from downtown, where you will find world class dining, entertainment, museums and hotels.  A short hop from Bardtown road shopping and nightlife.  Our new bicycle lanes make it easy to get out and enjoy the fresh air being provided by the many newly planted trees.  Come see all we have to offer!
